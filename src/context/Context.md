# Context

For the context of our app, we have set a possible environment where our app could be used.

 There are several variables that we have been considered so that is why we had to create several classes with a lot of types of data in order to represent all that stuff. Some of them include position, available gas, planned routes or free places in parkings. 

Then when we had it modeled we started to generate data for our models based on reality in order to start creating magic with algorithms and machine learning and make them work.
