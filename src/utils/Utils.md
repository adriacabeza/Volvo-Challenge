# Utils

- A tool that uses OCR to extract the text from the driver license and check most of the text to see if it is a really license
- Function to delete temporary folders
  - I guess that whenever we take selfies of the users we are going to delete those folders. Also after confirming the driver license is fine we can delete it too.
- A function to compress a picture (we must use it if we want to use several pictures)
